/* Filename: ExtraCreditSimulation.java 
* Created by: Xinyi He(cs8aware) and Kaixun Zhang(cs8awatp)
* Date: Jan,22,2017
* 1.I investigated The Monty Hall problem
* 
* 2.My investigation contains two parts:
* First,investigate the average chance of winning a car by sticking to the initial choice
* Second,investigate the average chance of winning a car by switching to the other door
* 
* Experiment:first,randomly put a car behind one of the three doors labeled 0,1,2
* Then the player choose one of the three doors 
* In 100000 trials,the player didn't change their choices,if they chose the car they would win.
* In another 100000 trials,the player change their choices,
*     if they first chose the car, after switching to the other door they would lose
*     if they first chose the goat, after switching to the other door they would win
* 
* I use for,while loops and if statement in my code to perform the experiment.
* 
* 3.My results show that switching to the other door wins twice as often as staying.
* So people should always switch their guesses.
