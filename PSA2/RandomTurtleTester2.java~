* Question A: Average final signed-displacement for a random walker after making 100 random steps

* | probabilityLeft = 0.25 | probabilityLeft = 0.5 | probabilityLeft = 0.75 | 
* | Displacement =  50082   | Displacement = -84    | Displacement = -50184  |
* Average final signed-displacement: 50.08    | -0.08  |  -50.18
*  Comment on the result:
* When probabilityLeft=0.5,the absolte value of displacement and of the average final signed-displacement are the smallest.
* When probabilityLeft=0.25 and 0.75,their absolute value of displacement and of the average final signed-displacement are almost the same.
* 
* Question B
* 1) 100 random steps   (THIS ANSWER SHOULD BE THE SAME AS QUESTION A’S ANSWER)
* | probabilityLeft = 0.25 | probabilityLeft = 0.5 | probabilityLeft = 0.75 | 
* | Displacement =  50082  | Displacement = -84    | Displacement = -50184  |
* Average final signed-displacement: 50.08  | -0.08 |   -50.18
* 
* 2) 10 random steps
* | probabilityLeft = 0.25 | probabilityLeft = 0.5 | probabilityLeft = 0.75 | 
* | Displacement = 5000    | Displacement = -38    | Displacement = -4964   |
* Average final signed-displacement: 5.00 | -0.04 |  -4.96
* 
* 3) 1000 random steps
* | probabilityLeft = 0.25 | probabilityLeft = 0.5 | probabilityLeft = 0.75 | 
* | Displacement =  498490 | Displacement = 254    | Displacement = -498740  |
* Average final signed-displacement: 498.49 |  0.25 | -498.74
*  Comment on the result: …
* 1.number of steps is the same: (1)when the probabilityLeft gets closer to 0.5,
* its absolute displacement and absolute average displacement get smaller. 
* (2)the absolute value of displacement and of the average final signed-displacement are almost the same when probabilityLeft = 0.25 and 0.75
* 2.probabilityLeft is the same: when the number of steps gets bigger,
* its absolute displacement and average squared displacement get bigger.
* 

* Question C: Average squared displacement for a random walker after making 100 random steps
* 
* | probabilityLeft = 0.25 | probabilityLeft = 0.5 | probabilityLeft = 0.75 | 
* | Displacement = 49982   | Displacement = 106    | Displacement = -49986  |
* Average squared displacement:  2570.18    | 101.89  |  2573.78
*  Comment on the result:
* 1. When probabilityLeft=0.5,the absolute value of displacement and the average squared displacement are the smallest.
* 2. When probabilityLeft =0.25 and 0.75,the absolute displacement and the average squared displacement are almost the same.
* 
* Question D
* 1) 100 random steps   
* | probabilityLeft = 0.25 | probabilityLeft = 0.5 | probabilityLeft = 0.75 | 
* | Displacement =  49982  | Displacement = 106    | Displacement = -49986  |
* Average squared displacement: 2570.18 | 101.89 |  2573.78
* 
* 2) 10 random steps
* | probabilityLeft = 0.25 | probabilityLeft = 0.5 | probabilityLeft = 0.75 | 
* | Displacement = 5004    | Displacement = -100   | Displacement = -5010   |
* Average squared signed-displacement: 32.37 | 9.98| 32.15
* 
* 3) 1000 random steps
* | probabilityLeft = 0.25 | probabilityLeft = 0.5 | probabilityLeft = 0.75 | 
* | Displacement = 500816  | Displacement = 1406   | Displacement = -500218 |
* Average squared displacement: 251579.58    |  1051.24  | 250927.32
*  Comment on the result: 
* 1.number of steps is the same: (1)when the probabilityLeft gets closer to 0.5,
* its absolute displacement and average squared displacement get smaller.
* (2)the absolute displacement and the average squared displacement are almost the same when probabilityLeft = 0.25 and 0.75
* 2.probabilityLeft is the same: when the number of steps gets bigger,
* its absolute displacement and average squared displacement get bigger.
* 
* So, in total you would have done 24 experiments
