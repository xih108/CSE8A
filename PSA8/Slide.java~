/*--------PROGRAM DESCRIPTION----------
*This program focuses on creating slides and then show them.
*Slide.java fileï¼š
*It has two instance variables: 
*pic refers to the picture of the Slide object.
*sound refers to the sound of the Slide Object.
*
*It has two constructors: 
*public Slide() takes no parameters and sets pic and sound to null. 
*public Slide(Picture inPic,Sound inSound) takes 2 parameters,inPic&inSound. 
*sets pic to inPic, sets sound to inSound.
*
*It has three methods: 
*It has method changePic to change the picture of the slide by inPic. 
*It has method changeSound to change the sound of the slide by inSound.
*It has method showSlide to show the picture(flip horizontally or vertically)
*and play the sound(reversely or not) at the same time.
*Then hide the picture after the sound ends.
* 
*Slideshow.java file: 
*It has two instance variables: 
*slides refers to the slide array of Slideshow object.
*probFlip means the probability of flipping.
* 
*It has two constructors: 
*public Slideshow() takes no parameters and initializes the slides array. 
*public Slideshow(double inProb) takes an input parameter for probFlip, 
*and initializes the slides array. 
*
*It has five methods:
*It has method changeProbFlip to changes value of probFlip to inProb. 
*It has method addSlide to add a slide to the end of the slides array. 
*It has method changeSlide to change the slide at the given index to inSlide. 
*It has method show to show the entire slideshow. 
*It has a main method to run your slideshow.
